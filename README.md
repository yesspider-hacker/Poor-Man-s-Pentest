# Poor-Man-s-Pentest

This project and code is no longer maintained or supported.

This idea began as a very crude way to "automate" simple tasks on a remote target, by using xte and X11 automation utilities to merely send keys and simulate keyboard strokes. This would run commands on the target if a window with a reverse shell or bind shell was displayed on your desktop. It was extremely primitive -- it had no way of determining the output of commands, if commands were truly present, and it was a hodgepodge of haphazard scripts that had no support or error checking.

The use of the Poor Man's Pentest is NOT RECOMMENDED and this repository is archived.

It is recommended you use pwncat for things like this.
